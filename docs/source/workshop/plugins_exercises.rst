Expanding the Tutorial Plugin
--------------------------------

There's a couple ridiculous things happening in the tutorial example that I would like to talk about and change in this next section: 

    * Everytime we click the map canvas a signal is sent out, and our slot (or handler function)\  ``selectFeature()`` \runs and does a number of things before selecting a feature:
        * gets the current layer
        * gets the current layer's data provider

Let's make this simplier by reorganizing things to be more eventd driven. Whenever a layer is selected in the TOC it will fire a signal. This then seems like a good place to put anything intialization code for the current layer or data provider since we'll be handling things one-at-a-time. 

Let's expand on the last tutorial and add one more feature. We want to output a 'NAME' attribute to the TextBrowser if it exists. Most of what we have to do to implement this is code reorganization. 

First, let's ensure that everytime a selection is made that we have a class variable that holds that information for all class functions to use. In fact, we need to move many variables to the class level that appear in\  ``selectFeature()`` \function. That means we'll have to move the\  ``selectList`` \variable out from the\  ``selectFeature()`` \function and put it under\  ``__init__()`` \.

your file should now look like\  `this module <../_static/vector_selectbypoint(2nd_hour_ex_1).rst>`_ \
